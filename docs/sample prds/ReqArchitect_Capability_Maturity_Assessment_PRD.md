# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Capability Maturity Assessment System

**Product:** ReqArchitect  
**Feature:** Capability Maturity Assessment & Intelligence Engine  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Owner:** Product Management  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

ReqArchitect will deliver an AI-powered Capability Maturity Assessment system that automatically evaluates organizational capabilities by analyzing existing data (Business Model Canvas, application inventory, cost structures, and capability-to-tech mappings). Unlike traditional assessment tools requiring extensive manual input, this system provides continuous, context-aware maturity scoring with actionable recommendations—reducing assessment time from days to minutes while maintaining accuracy above 85%.

**Key Innovation:** The system infers maturity levels from observable signals (tools used, integration patterns, spend efficiency) rather than relying on subjective questionnaires, creating a living assessment that evolves as the organization changes.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points

**For Organizations:**
- Traditional maturity assessments require 20-40 hours of consultant time per assessment
- Point-in-time assessments become outdated within months
- Heavy questionnaires suffer from response bias and assessment fatigue
- No connection between maturity scores and actual tooling/costs
- Recommendations are generic, not tied to specific gaps in the tech stack
- No benchmarking against similar organizations

**For Startups (ReqArchitect's Core Audience):**
- Cannot afford expensive consultant-led assessments
- Lack expertise to self-assess accurately
- Need rapid identification of capability gaps before they become crises
- Require continuous monitoring as they scale rapidly
- Must justify technology investments to boards/investors with maturity data

**Market Gap:**
- Enterprise tools (LeanIX, Ardoq) offer capability modeling but require manual maturity input
- Assessment frameworks (CMMI, TOGAF) are too heavy for startups
- No tool automatically infers maturity from observable data

## 4. Feature Requirements

## 4.1 Core Assessment Engine

### 4.1.1 Maturity Framework Definition

**Requirement:** System must support configurable maturity frameworks

**Default Framework: 5-Level Model**

| Level | Name | Description | Typical Characteristics |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Initial | Ad-hoc, reactive, individual heroics | Manual processes, no documentation, spreadsheet-based |
| 2 | Managed | Basic processes defined, some repeatability | Departmental tools, basic metrics, informal governance |
| 3 | Defined | Standardized processes, organization-wide | Integrated tools, documented workflows, defined owners |
| 4 | Quantitatively Managed | Data-driven optimization, predictive | Advanced analytics, automation, continuous monitoring |
| 5 | Optimizing | Continuous improvement, innovation focus | AI-powered, self-healing, industry-leading practices |

**Customization Support:**
- Administrators can modify level definitions
- Industry-specific frameworks (e.g., CMMI for software, HIMSS for healthcare)
- Capability-specific criteria variations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Default 5-level framework loads automatically for new workspaces
- [ ] Admin interface to edit level names, descriptions, and criteria
- [ ] Support for 3-7 level frameworks (configurable)
- [ ] Framework changes auto-recalculate all capability scores
- [ ] Audit log of framework modifications

---

### 4.1.2 Maturity Inference Engine (AI Core)

**Requirement:** Automatically infer capability maturity from observable data

**Data Sources for Inference:**

1. **Application/Tool Analysis**
   - Tool category: Manual (spreadsheet) → Level 1, Departmental SaaS → Level 2, Enterprise integrated → Level 3-4, AI-powered → Level 4-5
   - Tool count per capability: Single tool = lower, redundant tools = wasteful, right-sized suite = higher
   - Tool sophistication: Free/basic tier → lower, enterprise tier with advanced features → higher
   - Integration status: Siloed → lower, API-connected → higher, event-driven architecture → highest

2. **Process Automation Signals**
   - Workflow automation presence (e.g., Zapier/Power Automate flows detected)
   - RPA/bot usage indicators
   - Manual touchpoints (inferred from support tool tickets, process docs)

3. **Cost & Investment Patterns**
   - Spend per capability as % of total (underinvestment = lower maturity)
   - Cost efficiency vs. benchmarks (overspend on basics = inefficient = lower)
   - Growth in investment (increasing = improving maturity signal)

4. **Documentation & Governance**
   - Presence of process documentation (linked in capability)
   - Owner assignment (owned = higher, orphaned = lower)
   - KPI definition (measured = higher, unmeasured = lower)

5. **Integration Density**
   - Number of integrations between capability's tools and other systems
   - Data flow completeness (gaps = lower maturity)

**Inference Algorithm:**

```
For each capability:
  1. Analyze all linked applications → generate tool_maturity_score (1-5)
  2. Check automation indicators → generate automation_score (1-5)
  3. Calculate cost efficiency → generate investment_score (1-5)
  4. Assess documentation/governance → generate governance_score (1-5)
  5. Evaluate integration completeness → generate integration_score (1-5)
  
  6. Weighted calculation:
     base_score = (tool_maturity_score * 0.35) + 
                  (automation_score * 0.25) + 
                  (investment_score * 0.15) +
                  (governance_score * 0.15) +
                  (integration_score * 0.10)
  
  7. Apply confidence factor (0.5-1.0 based on data completeness)
  
  8. Round to nearest maturity level (1-5)
  
  9. Generate evidence summary (why this score)
  
  10. Flag uncertainty if confidence < 0.7 → trigger validation question
```

**Machine Learning Enhancement (Post-MVP):**
- Train ML model on validated assessments to improve inference accuracy
- Pattern recognition across anonymized multi-tenant data
- Anomaly detection (unusual tool combinations, mismatched investment)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Engine processes all user capabilities within 5 seconds of data update
- [ ] Inference accuracy ≥85% when compared to expert manual assessment (validation set of 50 capabilities)
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated for each assessment
- [ ] Evidence list generated showing top 3 factors influencing score
- [ ] System flags low-confidence assessments (<0.7) for user validation
- [ ] Re-assessment triggered automatically when source data changes (tool added/removed, cost updated)

---

### 4.1.3 Validation Question Engine

**Requirement:** Minimal-friction validation for low-confidence assessments

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Confidence score < 0.7
- Conflicting signals (e.g., expensive enterprise tool but no integrations)
- Newly created capability with minimal data
- User requests manual override

**Question Design Principles:**
- Maximum 3-5 questions per capability
- Multiple choice or binary (yes/no) format only
- Pre-populated with AI's best guess (user confirms/corrects)
- Contextual: "We see you use Salesforce but no marketing automation tool - is lead nurturing performed manually?"

**Question Bank by Maturity Dimension:**

*Tool Sophistication:*
- "How do you primarily perform [capability function]?" → Options pre-filled from detected tools
- "Are these tools integrated or used separately?"

*Process Maturity:*
- "Is there documented process for [capability]?" (Yes/No/In Progress)
- "How often do you review/improve this process?" (Never/Annually/Quarterly/Continuously)

*Automation:*
- "What percentage of [capability] tasks are automated?" (0-25%/26-50%/51-75%/76-100%)

*Governance:*
- "Who owns this capability?" → Dropdown of team members
- "Do you track KPIs for this capability?" (Yes/No) → If yes, "How often reviewed?"

**User Experience:**
- Non-blocking: User can skip questions, assessment proceeds with lower confidence
- Batched: All questions for all capabilities presented together
- Progressive: Show 3 questions, reveal more only if user engages
- Persistent: Unanswered questions appear in dashboard "Complete your assessment" widget

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Validation questions appear only for capabilities with confidence <0.7
- [ ] Maximum 5 questions per capability displayed
- [ ] Questions pre-filled with AI inference for one-click confirmation
- [ ] User can skip any/all questions without blocking assessment
- [ ] Answering questions increases confidence score immediately
- [ ] "Complete Assessment" widget shows progress (e.g., "8 of 15 capabilities validated")

---

### 4.1.4 Continuous Monitoring & Auto-Updates

**Requirement:** Maturity scores automatically update as organizational data changes

**Trigger Events:**

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Application added to capability | Re-run inference for that capability |

| Cost data updated | Recalculate investment_score |
| Integration created/deleted | Update integration_score |
| Owner assigned/changed | Update governance_score |
| Documentation linked | Update governance_score |
| User answers validation question | Incorporate answer, boost confidence |

**Change Detection & Alerting:**
- Detect significant maturity changes (≥1 level up or down)
- Generate alert: "Customer Service maturity dropped from Level 3 → Level 2" with reason
- Positive alerts too: "Analytics capability improved to Level 4!" 
- Weekly summary email: "3 capabilities improved, 1 declined this week"

**Historical Tracking:**

1. Sort capabilities by confidence score (lowest first)
2. For each low-confidence capability, select 1-2 most impactful questions
3. Batch similar questions across capabilities (e.g., ask about owners for all capabilities in one section)
4. Adaptive: If user answers consistently (e.g., always confirms AI's guess), reduce questions

**Question Formats:**

**Binary Confirmation:**
```
✓ We detected you use [Tool X] for [Capability Y]
  → [Confirm] [That's wrong, we use: ____]
```

**Maturity Level Selection:**
```
How would you describe your [Capability] maturity?
○ Level 1: Ad-hoc, mostly manual
○ Level 2: Basic processes, some tools
● Level 3: Standardized, integrated tools [AI's suggestion]
○ Level 4: Data-driven, highly automated
○ Level 5: Continuous optimization, industry-leading
```

**Multi-Select Evidence:**
```
Which of these best describes your [Capability]? (select all)
☑ We have documented processes [AI detected process docs]
☐ We track KPIs regularly

### 4.2.3 Confidence Scoring & Transparency

**Requirement:** Users understand how confident the system is in its assessments

**Confidence Score Calculation:**

```
confidence = (data_completeness * 0.4) + 
             (signal_consistency * 0.3) + 
             (user_validation * 0.3)

Where:
- data_completeness = % of expected data fields populated (tools, costs, docs, owner)
- signal_consistency = how well signals agree (e.g., expensive tool + no integrations = inconsistent = lower)
- user_validation = 0 if not validated, 0.5 if partially validated, 1.0 if fully validated
```

**Transparency Features:**

1. **Confidence Indicator:** Show confidence % next to each score
   - <50%: Red, "Low confidence - please validate"
   - 50-70%: Yellow, "Moderate confidence - quick check recommended"
   - >70%: Green, "High confidence"

2. **Evidence Panel:** Expandable section showing:
   - "Why we assigned Level 3:"
   - ✓ Using enterprise-grade tools (Salesforce, Tableau)
   - ✓ 2 integrations detected
   - ✗ No documented processes found
   - ✗ No KPIs tracked
   - → "Overall: Strong tooling, weak governance"

3. **Data Completeness Indicator:**
   - "Assessment based on: Tools ✓, Costs ✓, Processes ✗, Owner ✓"
   - CTA: "Add process documentation to improve accuracy"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Confidence score displayed as percentage next to maturity level
- [ ] Color-coding (red/yellow/green) visible at-a-glance
- [ ] Evidence panel expandable for every capability
- [ ] Evidence shows both positive signals (why score is high) and negative (what's missing)

### 4.4.3 Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loop

**Requirement:** System improves recommendations based on user actions

**Feedback Mechanisms:**

1. **Implicit Feedback:**
   - User clicks recommendation → Interest signal
   - User dismisses recommendation → "Not relevant" signal
   - User completes recommendation → "Effective" signal
   - Track: Which recommendations lead to maturity improvements?

2. **Explicit Feedback:**
   - After completing recommendation: "Did this help? ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
   - "Was the effort estimate accurate?" (Yes/No/Took longer/Took less time)
   - "Did maturity improve as expected?" (Auto-detected but ask user to confirm perception)

3. **A/B Testing:**
   - Test different recommendation phrasings
   - Test different prioritization algorithms
   - Measure: Click rate, completion rate, satisfaction

**Learning Loop:**

```
1. User acts on recommendation
2. Track outcome: Did maturity improve? By how much?
3. Compare to prediction
4. If actual > predicted: Boost similar recommendations for other users
5. If actual < predicted: Lower priority or revise recommendation
6. Aggregate across users: "Recommendation type X has 75% success rate"
7. Feed back into recommendation engine → improve future suggestions
```

**Personalization:**

- Learn user preferences: "Sarah tends to prefer low-cost recommendations"
- Learn organizational patterns: "This company values speed over cost"
- Tailor future recommendations accordingly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Feedback collected for every recommendation interaction
- [ ] Recommendation engine retrains monthly with new feedback data

}
```

### 5.3 AI/ML Components

**Maturity Inference Model:**
- **Type:** Supervised learning (regression or multi-class classification)
- **Inputs:** Tool categories, cost data, integration count, documentation flags, owner presence, etc.
- **Output:** Maturity level (1-5) + confidence score
- **Training:** Bootstrap with expert-labeled assessments (N=500-1000), then continuous learning from user validations
- **Framework:** scikit-learn or TensorFlow (if deep learning needed)
- **Deployment:** REST API service (containerized)

**Recommendation Engine:**
- **Type:** Rule-based initially, then collaborative filtering
- **Rules:** If tool_score < 3 AND budget > $X → recommend tool upgrade
- **Collaborative:** "Users similar to you who improved Capability X did Y"
- **Personalization:** Learn user preferences (cost-sensitive, speed-focused, etc.)

**NLP for Validation Questions:**
- **Use Case:** Parse user free-text responses to validation questions
- **Model:** Fine-tuned BERT for classification (positive/negative validation, topic extraction)
- **Example:** User says "We do track tickets but manually in spreadsheets" → Extract: tracking=yes, automation=no → Adjust governance_score up, automation_score down

### 5.4 Integrations

**Internal ReqArchitect Data:**
- Business Model Canvas (strategic context)
- Application Inventory (tools and costs)
- Cost Management Module (spend data)
- Team Management (owners, roles)

**External Integrations (Optional/Future):**
- **SSO/HRIS:** Pull employee data to calculate per-employee spend
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, GCP, Azure usage/cost APIs
- **SaaS Management Tools:** Cledara, Torii, Zylo (import tool inventory)
- **Project Management:** Jira, Asana (track recommendation completion)
- **BI Tools:** Tableau, Power BI (export maturity data)

**Data Sync:**
- Real-time: Application added/removed → trigger re-assessment
- Batch: Nightly sync of cost data from finance systems
- Event-driven: Webhook from integrated tool → update relevant capability

### 5.5 Performance & Scalability

**Requirements:**
- Dashboard load: <2 seconds for 50 capabilities
- Inference engine: Process capability in <1 second
- Concurrent users: Support 10,000 organizations, 100,000 users
- Data retention: 5 years of historical assessments

**Scalability Strategies:**
- Horizontal scaling: Microservices (inference, recommendations, reporting)
- Caching: Redis for frequently accessed benchmarks and dashboards
- Async processing: Kafka for events (tool added → queue re-assessment)
- Database partitioning: Shard by organization_id

---

## 6. User Experience (UX) Guidelines

### 6.1 Design Principles

1. **Clarity over Complexity:** Maturity scores are simple (1-5), not esoteric metrics
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show summary first, details on demand
3. **Actionability:** Every low score must link to recommendations
4. **Transparency:** Always show why a score was assigned (evidence)
5. **Non-Judgmental:** Avoid "bad" labels; use "opportunity for improvement"
6. **Encouraging:** Celebrate improvements ("🎉 You reached Level 4!")

### 6.2 Visual Design

**Color Palette (Maturity Levels):**
- Level 1-2: Red/Orange (attention needed)
- Level 3: Yellow/Amber (adequate)
- Level 4-5: Green/Blue (strong)

**Iconography:**
- Maturity level: Ladder or progress bar
- Confidence: Shield with percentage
- Recommendations: Light bulb
- Alerts: Warning triangle
- Trends: Arrow up/down

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Bold, large for scores (e.g., "3.2 / 5.0")
- Body: Clear, readable (16px minimum)
- Data labels: Small but legible

### 6.3 Accessibility

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Internationalization:** Support multiple languages (initially English, then Spanish, French, German)

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Inference accuracy too low** | High (users won't trust system) | Medium | Start with heavily validated assessments; be transparent about confidence; allow easy overrides |
| **User assessment fatigue** | High (abandonment) | Medium | Minimize questions (target <10); pre-populate aggressively; make validation optional |
| **Insufficient benchmark data** | Medium (less valuable insights) | High (at launch) | Bootstrap with synthetic data; incentivize data sharing (better benchmarks for contributors) |
| **Complexity overwhelms target users** | High (adoption failure) | Medium | Extensive user testing; progressive disclosure; onboarding wizard; templates |
| **Privacy concerns (data sharing)** | Medium (legal issues) | Low | Clear opt-in; full anonymization; compliance with GDPR/CCPA; audit trail |
| **Recommendation irrelevance** | Medium (ignored feature) | Medium | Feedback loops; A/B test recommendations; personalization based on user actions |
| **Technical debt in inference engine** | Medium (maintenance burden) | Medium | Invest in testing; modular design; document ML models; version control for models |

---

## 10. Open Questions & Future Research

1. **Maturity Framework Customization:** How much should users be able to customize the maturity levels? Risk of fragmentation vs. flexibility.

2. **Capability Taxonomy:** Should we enforce a standard taxonomy (e.g., "Customer Service" vs. "Support") or allow free-form naming? 

3. **Real-Time Scoring:** Should maturity scores update in real-time (as tools added) or batched (daily)? Trade-off: Freshness vs. stability (avoid score whiplash).

4. **Gamification:** Would leaderboards or badges ("Achieved Level 4 in 5 capabilities!") increase engagement or feel gimmicky?

5. **Consultant Integration:** Should we build a marketplace for consultants to offer "Maturity Improvement Services"? Revenue share model?

6. **External Validation:** Partner with industry bodies (ISACA, PMI) to certify our maturity framework? Increases credibility but adds overhead.

7. **Weighted Capabilities:** Should some capabilities be weighted more heavily in overall score (e.g., Security > Internal Communications)? How to determine weights?

8. **AI Explainability:** How much detail to show in "why this score" explanations? Balance transparency with overwhelming users.

### Appendix B: Example Recommendations

**Capability: Analytics & Business Intelligence**
**Current Level: 2 (Managed)**
**Target Level: 4 (Quantitatively Managed)**

**Recommendation 1: Implement Self-Service BI Tool**
- **Why:** Level 3 requires standardized reporting accessible to all stakeholders
- **Suggested Tools:** Power BI ($10/user/mo), Tableau ($70/user/mo), Looker (custom pricing)
- **Cost:** $300-2,000/month (depends on users)
- **Effort:** 3-4 weeks (setup, connect data sources, create dashboards)
- **Impact:** +1 maturity level, 10-15 hours/week saved on manual reporting
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. Assess data sources (databases, APIs)
  2. Trial Power BI Pro (14-day free trial)
  3. Build 3-5 core dashboards
  4. Train team on self-service reporting

**Recommendation 2: Centralize Data Warehouse**
- **Why:** Level 4 requires integrated, high-quality data for analytics
- **Suggested Approach:** Cloud data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- **Cost:** $500-5,000/month (usage-based)
- **Effort:** 6-8 weeks (design schema, ETL pipelines, migrate data)
- **Impact:** +1 maturity level, enables advanced analytics (ML, real-time)
- **Dependencies:** Requires BI tool (see Rec 1) to extract value
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Inventory all data sources
  2. Choose warehouse platform (trial available)
  3. Design dimensional model
  4. Implement ETL (use Fivetran, Stitch, or custom)

**Recommendation 3: Automate Data Quality Checks**
- **Why:** Level 4 requires quantitative management (detecting data issues proactively)
- **Suggested Tools:** Great Expectations (open-source), Monte Carlo, Datafold
- **Cost:** $0 (open-source) to $1,000+/month (enterprise)
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks (define quality rules, set up monitoring)
- **Impact:** +0.5 maturity level, prevent downstream analytics errors
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Define data quality rules (completeness, accuracy, timeliness)
  2. Implement Great Expectations (free, Python-based)
  3. Set up alerts for quality violations

### Appendix C: Maturity Level Definitions (Detail)

**Level 1: Initial**
- Processes are unpredictable, reactive
- Success depends on individual heroics
- Little to no documentation
- Mostly manual workflows
- Tools: Spreadsheets, email, paper-based
- No metrics or KPIs tracked
- Example: Startup founder handling all customer support via personal email

**Level 2: Managed**
- Basic processes defined at departmental level
- Some repeatability, but inconsistent across org
- Initial documentation (may be outdated)
- Basic tools adopted (entry-level SaaS)
- Some metrics tracked ad-hoc
- Example: Support team using Zendesk, but no formal escalation process; metrics reviewed monthly

**Level 3: Defined**
- Standardized processes documented and followed org-wide
- Governance established (process owners, regular reviews)
- Integrated tools (systems talk to each other)
- Metrics tracked consistently, reported regularly
- Example: Formal support SOP, Zendesk integrated with CRM, CSAT tracked weekly, support team trained

**Level 4: Quantitatively Managed**
- Data-driven decision making (metrics guide improvements)
- Advanced automation (workflows, alerts, approvals)
- Predictive capabilities (forecasting, trend analysis)
- Continuous monitoring (dashboards, real-time alerts)
- Example: Support operations dashboard predicts ticket spikes, chatbot handles 50% of inquiries, proactive outreach to at-risk customers

**Level 5: Optimizing**
- Continuous improvement culture (Kaizen, retrospectives)
- Innovation-focused (experimenting with new practices/tools)
- Industry-leading capabilities (benchmarked in top 10%)
- AI-powered optimization (self-healing systems, adaptive processes)
- Example: AI analyzes support transcripts to auto-improve knowledge base, predictive models route complex tickets to specialists, feedback loops from customers directly update product roadmap

## 13. Conclusion

This PRD outlines a comprehensive, AI-powered Capability Maturity Assessment system that will position ReqArchitect as the leading platform for startup operational intelligence. By automating the traditionally manual and consultant-heavy process of maturity assessment, we enable founders and teams to:

1. **Rapidly understand** where they stand across all business capabilities
2. **Continuously monitor** improvements (or regressions) in real-time
3. **Act decisively** on prioritized, actionable recommendations
4. **Benchmark confidently** against peers to stay competitive
5. **Scale systematically** with a clear roadmap from current to target state

The key innovation is **context-aware automation**: the system infers maturity from observable signals (tools, costs, integrations) rather than burdening users with lengthy questionnaires. This approach, combined with AI-driven recommendations and continuous learning, creates a living assessment that evolves with the organization.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this PRD (target: 1 week)
2. Conduct technical feasibility assessment (inference engine, ML models)
3. Create detailed UX designs and prototypes (2 weeks)
4. Kickoff Phase 1 development (MVP sprint planning)
5. Recruit beta testers (20 customers, diverse stages/industries)

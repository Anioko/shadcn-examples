- Architecture and implementation
- Costs and business value
- Capabilities and supporting systems
- Initiatives and strategic goals
- Risks and controls

### Context Graph Model

**Entity Types:**
```
- StrategyNode: Vision, Goals, OKRs, Initiatives
- ArchitectureNode: Capabilities, Services, Components, Interfaces
- OperationsNode: Processes, Workflows, Policies
- FinanceNode: Costs, Budgets, Investments
- ProjectNode: Projects, Tasks, Resources
- RiskNode: Risks, Controls, Issues
- IntegrationNode: Systems, APIs, Connectors
```

**Relationship Types:**
```

- COSTS: Service COSTS Budget
- ENABLES: Initiative ENABLES Goal
- MITIGATES: Control MITIGATES Risk
- DEPENDS_ON: Service DEPENDS_ON Service
- OWNS: Person OWNS Capability
- IMPACTS: Risk IMPACTS Capability
```

**Context Query Examples:**
```graphql
# Find all services supporting a strategic goal
query ServicesForGoal($goalId: ID!) {
  goal(id: $goalId) {
    name
    capabilities {
      name
      services {
        name
        status
        cost
        owner
      }
    }
  }
}

# Find all risks impacting a specific capability
query RisksForCapability($capabilityId: ID!) {
  capability(id: $capabilityId) {
    name
    risks {
      severity
      likelihood
      description
      controls {
        name
        effectiveness
      }
    }
  }
}

# Calculate total cost to achieve a goal
query CostToAchieveGoal($goalId: ID!) {
  goal(id: $goalId) {
    initiatives {
      projects {
        tasks {
          estimatedHours
          assignee {
            hourlyRate
          }
        }
      }
    }
    capabilities {
      services {
        monthlyCost
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Context Inference Engine

**Functionality:**
- Automatic relationship detection
- Pattern matching for similar contexts
- Anomaly detection in context graph
- Recommendation generation

**Inference Rules:**
```python
# Example inference rules

# If a Goal has no Capabilities supporting it → Flag as gap
if goal.capabilities.count() == 0:
    alert(f"Strategic goal '{goal.name}' has no supporting capabilities")

# If a Capability is critical but has single service → Flag as risk
if capability.criticality == "HIGH" and capability.services.count() == 1:
    risk = Risk(
        type="SinglePointOfFailure",
        severity="HIGH",
        description=f"Capability '{capability.name}' depends on single service"
    )

# If Service cost increases >20% month-over-month → Flag for review
if service.cost_change_pct > 20:
    alert(f"Service '{service.name}' cost increased {service.cost_change_pct}%")

# If Project has no link to Goals → Flag as potential scope creep
if project.goals.count() == 0 and project.status == "IN_PROGRESS":
    alert(f"Project '{project.name}' has no strategic goal alignment")
```

### Context Propagation

**Change Impact Analysis:**
When any entity changes, the system propagates implications through the context graph:

```
Example: Service "Payment Gateway" experiences outage

1. Identify impacted capabilities
   - Payment Processing (HIGH severity)
   - Order Fulfillment (MEDIUM severity)

2. Trace to business impact
   - Goal "Revenue Growth" at risk
   - KPI "Transaction success rate" affected
   - Customer experience degraded

3. Identify stakeholders to notify
   - Service Owner: Engineering Lead
   - Capability Owner: VP Product
   - Goal Owner: CEO

4. Recommend actions
   - Activate backup payment provider
   - Communicate to customers
   - Post-mortem after resolution
```

**Scenario Modeling:**
```
Question: "What if we increase pricing by 20%?"

Context analysis:
1. Revenue model change → Update financial projections
2. Customer segment impact → Analyze churn risk
3. Competitive positioning → Reassess market strategy
4. Sales process → Update pricing in CRM
5. Billing system → Configuration changes needed
6. Documentation → Update pricing pages, FAQs

Projected outcomes:
- Revenue impact: +$50K MRR (if churn stays below 5%)
- Customer risk: 12 customers above value threshold (high churn risk)
- Implementation effort: 2-3 days (systems + docs)
- Risk: Competitive disadvantage if features don't justify premium
```

### Context Versioning

**Functionality:**

## User Experience Design

### Design Principles

1. **Context is King**: Always show users the "why" behind data, not just the "what"
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
3. **Guided Workflows**: AI-powered next steps and recommendations
4. **Visual First**: Prefer diagrams, graphs, and visual representations over tables
5. **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on mobile, tablet, desktop
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum

### Key User Flows
